 - I'm @titusmaxentius, a knit designer, photographer, and software developer in my spare time.
 - I'm working primarily on designs for Kniterate machines, and code for PASSAP software development. 
 - I've taken a large amount of concepts from Carnegie Mellon's research, and expanded those for PASSAP machines (namely the E6000, since that's the one I currently own), as well as for Brother KH970 machines.
